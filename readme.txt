Embed the ThingsToGetMe wish-list maker on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

The ThingsToGetMe plugin allows you to embed our wish-list maker directly on to your WordPress website.

When your users create their wish list, and share it with family and friends, they all come to your website to view the list.

This means an increase in visitor numbers to your website.  For every list shared, you can expect around 50 new visitors - that's the sort of numbers we see at ThingsToGetMe.com

The plugin embeds a version of our wish-list maker, which is hosted at https://www.thingstogetme.com
